# Improbable Mission

_Stay awhile ... stay forever!_

In 1984, a maniacal villain taunted players from their Commodore 64 screens, and ["Impossible Mission"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission), a game published by [Epyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyx), became an instant classic. With its groundbreaking digitized speech, acrobatic platforming, and race-against-time puzzle-solving, this game captivated a generation of gamers on the C64, ZX Spectrum, and other home computers of the era.

This repository is my attempt to bring that iconic experience to the modern web through a JavaScript reimplementation. My slight renaming of the game here is to ensure I avoid any suggestions of infringement. The use of "improbable" also reflects the likelihood of my actually being able to reproduce this game, particularly in JavaScript.

This project is a vanity project that may have the benefit of pedagogical usefulness. Thus, my releases will initially focus on highlighting areas of significant visible work. I suspect it will be awhile before I have an actual working game.
