## 📅 2025-10-24 — First Design Snapshot

I now have enough working to generate the basic game context on a canvas. The elevator appears on screen and can be moved up or down, with a corresponding sound effect for each movement. This confirms that I can:

- Load game assets (sprites + sounds)
- Animate sprites
- Play sounds
- Handle player input

I've also added a primary toolbar with core toggles:

- Enable/disable sound
- Switch color palette
- Toggle full-screen view
- Placeholder for the mission dossier (instructions)
